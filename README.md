# expense_tracker

I have built an Expense Tracker & Budget planner mobile application using Flutter. The functionality of the application are as follows,
# Sign Up/Sign In Screen: This uses Firebase User Authentication and Authorization. The user has to provide email Id and password
# Dashboard: Overview of recent transactions, existing balance.
# Analytics Screen: A graphical representation of expenses for the entire month.
# Goals Screen: Track and manage savings goals.
# User Profile Screen: Manage Display Name, Profile picture, Phone Number information
#‘+’ button on the Home screen i.e Dashboard navigates the user to Add Expenses/ Income screen where based on the user selection the input fields dynamically changes depending on Income/Expenses.
# Transaction Details Screen: On clicking each of the Dashboard recent transactions the user will be navigated to Transaction Details screen where the user will be able to edit or delete the transaction.
# For Web-enablement: I am using Firebase REST API for real-time database access and save user generated data with Firebase. 
# For storing profile images, I am using Storage in Firebase
